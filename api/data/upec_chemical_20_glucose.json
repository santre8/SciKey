    "abstract_s":"Taking into account the analytic patterns of different types of glucose-oxidase electrochemical sensors, the specific problems which have to be solved for such a sensor to be implantable are outlined. Of partic-ular interest is the lifetime of enzymatic membrane and the dependence of the sensor responses to oxygen concentration and hydrodynamics.",

    "abstract_s":"A very sensitive glucose electrode was developed using a glucose-oxidase membrane and an anodically polarized platinum disk. Calibration curves were linear over 4.5 concentration decades. It was adapted for human blood samples. The lifetime of glucose-oxidase collagen membranes was greater than 3 yr at 4°C and was ~ 6 month at 20-30°C.",
