    "title_s":"Harmonic mechanical excitations of steady convective instabilities: a means to get more uniform heat transfers in mixed convection flows?",
    "abstract_s":"In laminar mixed convection flows, steady thermoconvective patterns generate non uniform heat and\/or mass transfers at walls that can be detrimental in some industrial processes. For instance the longitudinal thermoconvective patterns of Poiseuille-Rayleigh-Bénard (PRB) flows generate non uniform thin films or coatings when they are present in cold wall horizontal Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) reactors. The aim of this paper is to show that, when the basic steady flow is convectively unstable against an unsteady flow regime, introducing small harmonic mechanical excitations in the basic flow may enable to obtain more uniform time averaged heat transfers. More specifically, three-dimensional direct numerical simulations are used to characterize the temperature field and wall heat transfer associated with unsteady wavy convective instabilities of PRB flows that result from harmonic excitations of the longitudinal thermoconvective rolls at channel inlet. A design of experiments is used to build cubic response surfaces of the different quantities analyzed (growth length of the wavy rolls, magnitude of their spanwise oscillations, wall Nusselt number ...) on a wide range of the flow parameters. Air PRB flows (Pr=0.71) in channels of aspect ratios equal to Width\/Height=10 and 150 < =Length\/Height < =300, for Reynolds numbers 100 < =Re < =300 and Rayleigh numbers 5000 < =Ra < =16000 are considered. Comparisons with experiments are presented and a good agreement is obtained. The optimal conditions to have uniform heat transfers on the horizontal walls of PRB flows correspond to the minimal growth length of the wavy rolls until saturation and the maximum magnitude of their spanwise oscillations. They are approximately obtained for moderate Reynolds number (Re≈150), high Rayleigh numbers (Ra≈15000), low excitation frequency and rather high excitation magnitude. A discussion of these results for the applications to CVD in horizontal rectangular reactors at atmospheric pressure is finally proposed.",

In particular, the present study focuses for the first time on the model (La, Mg)2Ni7 system. The calendar corrosion in 8.7 M KOH medium was investigated from 6 h to 16 weeks immersion. By a unique combination of structural and elemental characterisations, the corrosion products are evidenced in those systems.

    "abstract_s":"The cationic photoinitiating abilities of a series of 'push-pull' sulfonium-based photoacid generators (PAGs) have been investigated. In this linear π-conjugated series, a 4-<i>N,N<\/i>-diphenylaminostilbene subunit is associated with different types of sulfonium substituents, which are connected to the stilbene moiety either in the 4′ position or in the 3′ position. This <i>para<\/i>-to-<i>meta<\/i> substitution effect leads to a strong increase of the quantum yield for acid generation with a maximum value of <i>ca<\/i>. 0.5. Such a positioning effect has a strong influence on the efficiency of the S-C bond cleavage. A detailed photolysis mechanism has been proposed. In contrast to commercially available sulfonium salts, these highly reactive π-conjugated PAGs all exhibit large absorption in the visible range as well as large two-photon absorption cross-sections (δ<sub>max<\/sub> > 600 GM) in the near-infrared region. As a consequence, efficient one and two-photon polymerization reactions are observed at 405 nm and 800 nm, respectively, using typical monomers such as cyclohexene oxide, <i>n<\/i>-butyl vinyl ether or SU-8 photoresists. By the fabrication of well resolved two-dimensional microstructures, we finally demonstrate the potential use of these new generation PAGs in the fields of one and two-photon lithography.",

Test calculations are also presented using the UCCSD(T)-F12 approach. The asymptotic regions are investigated for different relative orientations of the two moieties. It is shown that the three systems C2 + HX are bound, for intermolecular distances close to 3 Ang, through nucleophilic interactions between C2 and HX for approaches perpendicular to the C-C axis, with decreasing interaction energies from HF to HBr. For HX approaching C2 along its axis, the interactions, governed by the electrophilic character of C2 are decreasing from HBr to HF.

    "title_s":"In situ analysis of Titan's tholins by Laser 2 steps Desorption Ionisation",
    "abstract_s":"The main objective of the whole project developed in collaboration (LISA\/LATMOS) is to provide a better understanding of the chemical composition of Titan aerosols laboratory analogs, called tholins, and thereby of their formation pathways. The tholins are produced in the PAMPRE reactor (French acronyme for Aerosols Microgravity Production by Reactives Plasmas) developed at LATMOS. These tholins are generated in levitation (wall effects are thus limited) in a low pressure radiofrequency plasma. Up to now, the determination of the physical and chemical properties of these tholins was achieved after their collection and ex-situ analysis by several methods. Their bulk composition was then determined but their insoluble part is still unknown. Other studies were performed after the transfer of the soluble part of the aerosols to different analytical instruments. Therefore, possible artifacts could have influenced the results. We present the SMARD (a French acronym for Mass Spectrometry of Aerosols by InfraRed Laser Desorption) program. A challenging issue of our work is to perform the soluble and unsoluble parts of PAMPRE tholins' analysis in real time and in situ. The coupling of the PAMPRE reactor to a unique instrument (Single Particle Laser Ablation Mass Spectrometry) developed at LISA should allow determining in real time and in situ the characteristics (chemical composition together with granulometry) of the nanometric aerosols. The later are introduced in the analytical instrument using an aerodynamic lens device. Their detection and aerodynamic diameter are determined using two continuous diode lasers operating at λ = 403 nm. Then, the L2DI (Laser 2 steps Desorption Ionisation) technique is used in order to access to the chemical composition of individual particles: they are vaporized using a 10 μm CO2 pulsed laser and the gas produced is then ionized by a 248 nm KrF Excimer laser. Finally, the molecular ions are analyzed by a 1 m linear time-of-flight mass spectrometer. As a first step, tests have been realized using a model of aerosols particles [Dioctylphthalate, C6H4(COOC8H17)2, PM = 390] as well as tholins which have been solubilized in water. Both types of particles have been introduced in the system via a nebulizer placed at the entrance of the aerodynamic lens device. The results, that demonstrate the feasibility of the L2DI technique, will be presented. Aware that the KrF Excimer laser might induce dissociative ionization and only allow to detect aromatic molecular compounds, we plan to use a VUV (λ = 121.56 nm) laser. This would promote direct ionization (one photon process) of all kinds of species according to their respective threshold. The final step will be to directly analyze the tholins generated in the PAMPRE reactor.",

    "abstract_s":"Two Divisions of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), namely Physical Chemistry (Commission I.7 on Biophysical Chemistry, formerly Steering Committee on Biophysical Chemistry) and Analytical Chemistry (Commission V.5 on Electroanalytical Chemistry), have prepared recommendations on the definition, classification and nomenclature related to electrochemical biosensors; these recommendations could, in the future, be extended to other types of biosensors.An electrochemical biosensor is a self-contained integrated device, which is capable of providing specific quantitative or semi-quantitative analytical information using a biological recognition element (biochemical receptor) which is retained in direct spatial contact with an electrochemical transduction element. Because of their ability to be repeatedly calibrated, we recommend that a biosensor should be clearly distinguished from a bioanalytical system, which requires additional processing steps, such as reagent addition. A device which is both disposable after one measurement, i.e. single use, and unable to monitor the analyte concentration continuously or after rapid and reproducible regeneration should be designated a single-use biosensor.Biosensors may be classified according to the biological specificity-conferring mechanism or, alternatively, the mode of physicochemical signal transduction. The biological recognition element may be based on a chemical reaction catalysed by, or on an equilibrium reaction with, macromolecules that have been isolated, engineered or present in their original biological environment. In the latter case, equilibrium is generally reached and there is no further, if any, net consumption of analyte(s) by the immobilized biocomplexing agent incorporated into the sensor. Biosensors may be further classified according to the analytes or reactions that they monitor: direct monitoring of analyte concentration or of reactions producing or consuming such analytes; alternatively, an indirect monitoring of inhibitor or activator of the biologicalrecognition element (biochemical receptor) may be achieved.A rapid proliferation of biosensors and their diversity has led to a lack of rigour in defining their performance criteria. Although each biosensor can only truly be evaluated for a particular application, it is still useful to examine how standard protocols for performance criteria may be defined in accordance with standard IUPAC protocols or definitions. Thesecriteria are recommended for authors, referees and educators and include calibration characteristics (sensitivity, operational and linear concentration range, detection and quantitative determination limits), selectivity, steady-state and transient response times, sample throughput, reproducibility, stability and lifetime.Republication or reproduction of this report or its storage and\/or dissemination by electronic means is permitted without the need for formal IUPAC permission on condition that an acknowledgement, with full reference to the source along with use of the copyright symbol q, the name IUPAC and the year of publication are prominently visible.

    "abstract_s":"The importance of dissolved oxygen level in determining the platinum electrode potential in activated sludge has been clearly demonstrated by current-potential curves plotted at different oxygen concentration. Tests have been carried out, in the laboratory and in full scale treatment plants, to define the relationship between the platinum electrode potential at equilibrium (Eh) and the dissolved oxvgen [02) concentration in the activated sIudqe. These two parameters obey a law in the form Eh = a + b log [O2]. The measured values of coefficients a and b differ widely to those found from the oxygen reduction reaction in water (a = 0.8 V at pH 7 and b = 15 mV per decade). Factors a and b mainly depend on the sludge loading, the aeration conditions and the sludge concentration. Using non-polished stationary platinum ring electrodes, the following values of a were obtained (at pH between 7 and 7.6): + 410 mV\/NHE for sludge aerated for several hours without feeding, + 265 mV\/NHE for over-aerated\/low-loaded sludge (Cm = 0.2 kg BOD.kg MLVSS-1.day-1). Factor b would seem to lie between 55 and 65 mV when the sludge is continuously aerated without feeding. At low loads with excess aeration, it lies between 70 and 90 mV. When the medium is slightly septic at low dissolved oxygen concentrations (insufficient daily aeration time, high sludge concentration or aerators shut down for too long periods), factor b increases and can reach 200 mV. In the same way, at high loads, factor b can become 150 mV. These results demonstrate the importance of dissolved oxygen concentration in the mechanisms which determine the metal electrode potentials in activated sludge. They also illustrate the role that the electroactive species play in the process. The type and concentration of these species depend on parameters such as the sludge loading, the overall oxygen supply, the aeration sequence and the sludge concentration.",

    "abstract_s":"Of small species capable of reaching a platinum working electrode from biological samples, calcium cations have been found to inhibit significantly glucose biosensor responses. The sensitivities to glucose of sensors immersed in carbonate buffer saline solutions decreased when 0.5 mM calcium chloride was added. The degree of inhibition was proportional to the glucose response in the absence of calcium (0-17% of the normalized current). Likewise, sensor sensitivities to hydrogen peroxide decreased, in the 5-90% range, in the presence of 0.5 mM calcium. Bare Pt-Ir wires show a reversible inhibition of hydrogen peroxide sensitivity. This reversible inhibition is directly related to the decrease of hydrogen peroxide oxidation rate at the platinum anode: this has been evidenced, using rotating disk electrodes, by plotting Koutecky-Levich plots. Such inhibition has been found both for free and chelated calcium cations at levels below 1 mM. Several hypotheses for possible reactions between platinum, hydrogen per-oxide and calcium are discussed.",

    "title_s":"Electrochemical biosensors: recommended definitions and classification",
    "abstract_s":"Two Divisions of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), namely Physical Chemistry (Commission I.7 on Biophysical Chemistry formerly Steering Committee on Biophysical Chemistry) and Analytical Chemistry (Commission V.5 on Electroanalytical Chemistry) have prepared recommendations on the definition, classification and nomenclature related to electrochemical biosensors; these recommendations could, in the future, be extended to other types of biosensors. An electrochem-ical biosensor is a self-contained integrated device, which is capable of providing specific quantitative or semi-quantitative analytical information using a biological recognition element (biochemical receptor) which is retained in direct spatial contact with an electrochemical transduction element. Because of their ability to be repeatedly calibrated, we recommend that a biosensor should be clearly distinguished from a bioanalytical system, which requires additional processing steps, such as reagent addition. A device that is both disposable after one measurement, i.e. single use, and unable to monitor the analyte concentration continuously or after rapid and reproducible regeneration, should be designated a single use biosensor. Biosensors may be classified according to the biological specificity-conferring mechanism or, alternatively, to the mode of physico-chemical signal transduction. The biological recognition element may be based on a chemical reaction catalysed by, or on an equilibrium reaction with macromolecules that have been isolated, engineered or present in their original biological environment. In the latter cases, equilibrium is generally reached and there is no further, if any, net consumption of analyte(s) by the immobilized biocomplexing agent incorporated into the sensor. Biosensors may be further classified according to the analytes or reactions that they monitor: direct monitoring of analyte concentration or of reactions producing or consuming such analytes; alternatively, an indirect monitoring of inhibitor or activator of the biological recognition element (biochemical receptor) may be achieved. A rapid proliferation of biosensors and their diversity has led to a lack of rigour in defining their performance criteria. Although each biosensor can only truly be evaluated for a particular application, it is still useful to examine how standard protocols for performance criteria may be defined in accordance with standard IUPAC protocols or definitions. These criteria are recommended for authors, referees and educators and include calibration characteristics (sensitivity, operational and linear concentration range, detection and quantitative determination limits), selectivity, steady-state and transient response times, sample throughput, reproducibility, stability and lifetime.",

    "abstract_s":"River basin metal pollution originates from heavy industries (plating, automobile) and from urban sources (Paris conurbation: 2740 km2 , 9.47 million inhabitants). The natural sources of metal have been found to be limited due to sedimentary nature of this catchment and to the very low river sediment transport (10 t km − 2 y − 1). Several types of data have been collected to build the metal budget within the whole Seine River basin: field surveys, economical statistics and environmental models. Environmental contamination and related fluxes have been measured on atmospheric fallout, rural streams particles, and Seine River particles upstream and downstream of Paris and at river mouth. Metal pathways and budgets have been set up for (i) a typical cultivated area, (ii) a Paris combined sewer system, (iii) Paris conurbation and (iv) the whole catchment metal retention effect in floodplain and dredged material. Metal fluxes to the estuary have been decomposed into natural, urban domestic and other sources. The latter are within 1–2 orders of magnitude larger than waste water fluxes directly released into rivers according to an industrial census. These fluxes have been further compared to the annual use (1994–2003) of these metals. Metal excess fluxes exported by the river are now a marginal leak of metal inputs to the catchment (i.e. \"raw\" metals, metals in goods, atmospheric fallout), generally from 0.2 to 5‰. However, due to the very limited dilution power in this basin, the contamination of particles is still relatively high. The Seine River basin is gradually storing metals, mostly in manufactured products used in construction, but also in various waste dumps, industrial soils, agricultural and flood plain soils.",

This work, led by two different research groups, allowed to reach two main goals: to define a simple analytical procedure to secure accurate shipboard sampling and analysis of atmospheric deposition, and to assess anthropogenic impacts of heavy metals to the environment. The first step about the validation step showed that the prevalent deposition type was dry deposition which represents 40, 60 and 80% for Cd, Cu and Pb, respectively. This prevalence of dry deposition in total atmospheric fallout supported the necessity of funnel wall rinsing which contains 30, 50 and 40% of collected Cd, Cu and Pb, respectively. Moreover, the reproducibility of atmospheric deposition collection was determined. The second step was performed by comparing two sampling sites. A rural sampling site, situated in Morvan's regional park (250 km south-east of Paris), was chosen for its isolation from any local and regional contamination sources. Fluxes obtained in this area were compared with those obtained at an urban site (Creteil, suburb of Paris) allowing comparison between urban and rural areas and demonstrating the impact of anthropogenic activities on atmospheric deposition of Cr, Cu and Pb.",

Comparative study with and without compatibilizing copolymer agent (maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene: PP-g-AM) was conducted. The obtained results were interpreted in terms of silica nanoparticle-silica nanoparticle and silica nanoparticle-polymer interactions. These results have shown that the addition of nanofillers improves the properties of the nanocomposites. From transmission electron microscopy, it was found that agglomerations of silica particles into the PP matrix increased in average size with increasing silica contents, except in presence of the copolymer. Storage modulus values of the nanocomposites measured by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis were sensitive to the microstructure of the nanocomposites. Higher silica contents resulted in higher storage modulus, revealing that the material became stiffer. By adding the compatibilizer, a further increase of storage modulus was observed due to the finer dispersion of the filler in the matrix and the increased interfacial adhesion. Crystallization rates were found to increase with the increase of silica nanoparticles as well as PP-g-MA content. In addition, silica nanoparticles and the compatibilizing agent present centers of germination and nucleation of crystallites. Thus, the use of the coupling agent resulted in a further enhancement of mechanical properties of the nanocomposites due to the reduction of silica agglomeration.",

Local authorities that pioneered source control since the 1980s have already observed that small-scale facilities systematically implemented over a catchment are able to influence its hydrological behaviour. This capability is the main strength of source control, as it allows compensation for the negative effects of urbanization. Yet, it also represents its main risk: if initial decision-making is not sufficiently accurate, source control can produce long term negative effects. Because of its current spreading, source control will acquire an increasing role as a driver of hydrological changes in urban catchments, and the directions of these changes depend on current policy-making practices. This paper presents an analysis and a critical discussion of the main objectives that policy-makers attribute to stormwater source control. The investigation is based on a sample of French case studies, completed by a literature review for international comparison. It identifies four main objectives, some typical of urban stormwater management and some more innovative: flood reduction, receiving waters protection, sustainable development, costs reduction. The discussion focuses on how current policy-making practices are able to translate these objectives in concrete policy instruments, and on which knowledge and tools could improve this process. It is shown that for some objectives, basic knowledge is available, but the creation of policy instruments effective at the catchment scale and adapted to local conditions is still problematic. For others, substantial lacks of knowledge exist, casting doubts on long term effectiveness of current policy instruments. Research directions are identified to improve source control policies and thus the future hydrologic behaviour of many urban catchments.",

The proposed methodology corresponds to a convenient alternative to the direct use either of the Craig-Bampton method applied to the three substructures (using the fixed geometric interface modes) or of the flexibility residual approaches initiated by MacNeal (using the free geometric interface modes). In opposite to a geometrical interface which is a topological interface on which there is a direct linkage between the degrees of freedom of substructures, we consider a physical flexible interface which exists in certain present technologies and for which the general framework linear viscoelasticity is used and yields a frequency-dependent damping and stiffness matrices of the physical flexible interface.",

For such structures, a high modal density can be observed in the low- and in the medium-frequency bands.

A monitoring campaign of HCHO was performed during 96 days, with a short time-step (1 minute). The monitored formaldehyde time series exhibited, in particular, abrupt changes and structural breaks in variance, that cannot be modelled implicitly using simple models. To overcome this problem, hybrid model for forecasting HCHO time series (characterized by nonlinear and nonstationary behaviour) was used. The periodicities of the data were modelled by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). A Self-Exciting Threshold AutoRegressive (SETAR) model was used to model the FFT component. SETAR models are typically designed to accommodate the nonlinear features and can explain two regimes in a time series. The residuals of the FFT component subtracted from raw data was modelled using a second SETAR model. The output of the two models were summed and compared to raw test data.",

    "abstract_s":"At the border between the states of Ceará and Pernambuco (northeast Brazil), the Chapada do Araripe is a high plateau (800–1000 m a.s.l.) formed by a slab of Cenomanian fluvial sandstone. This caprock is underlain by lacustrine or marine Albian layers and older rift deposits. During the Cretaceous, the Araripe basin lay at a palaeoelevation close to sea-level. Through a presentation and discussion of original field and cartographic data we analyse the mechanisms of topographic inversion in this sedimentary basin in relation to local or regional crustal upwarp. The contrast between the plateau — a weakly dissected structural surface — and the surrounding lowlands is explained through a study of the erosional scarps — cuesta-like landforms and their outliers — that fringe the Chapada. No evidence of local tectonic inversion is found. River incision, spring sapping, landslides and other forms of mass movement are listed as efficient processes of topographic inversion and scarp retreat, the rates and patterns of which appear to be controlled by lithological contrasts and conditions of exhumation of the basement. Geometric relationships with regional stepped surfaces (e.g., the low-elevation Sertaneja Surface), exhumed palaeosurfaces and regional drainage systems are analysed. Our estimation of the amplitude of denudation and topographic inversion (0.6–0.7 km) differs significantly from apatite fission-track-derived estimates reported in recent literature, which would imply burial by considerable thicknesses of younger sediments followed by 1.5 km or more of post-rift denudation — not just in the study area, but also in the Tucano–Jatoba basin to the south. The exhumation and reworking of surrounding basement surfaces probably began during the early Cenozoic, as shown to the northwest of the Chapada by the presence of widespread laterites of probable Palaeogene age. A second stage of topographic inversion occurred during the Oligocene or later. This would correspond to the major stages of river incision, partial planation and basin inversion.",

    "abstract_s":"Steep slopes form the marginal scarp of the semi-arid northern Brazilian “Nordeste”, above depressions or corridors connected to a low erosion plain merging seaward with a coastal erosional-gradational piedmont. Dissected pediments and sparse debris fans visible at the base of some escarpments suggest recent erosive activity and possible slope retreat, although most of these forms are decoupled from major valleys. We describe the morphostructural patterns of chosen escarpments, in the basement as well as in the sedimentary cover, and the morphodynamic conditions of their evolution since the Miocene. Only a few scarps show strong structural control. Many of them are mainly inherited landforms, initiated during the Early Cretaceous rifting or the later margin uplift, a situation which suggests long-term stability. Later on, except in one case (the Araripe scarp), only slight or local backwearing took place, associated with downwearing on low surfaces and pediments, probably in diachronic ways. The Neogene clastic sedimentation on piedmonts and coastal areas mainly reflects the occurrence of dry periods inducing widespread stripping of deep soil horizons and erosion of bare rock slopes and surfaces. Dissection stages occurred in periods of more humid climate and\/or low sea level. Marks of strong recent of present activity are mainly registered in the rims of the Chapada do Araripe, owing to favourable structural, hydrogeological and climatic conditions. The moderate volumes of Neogene clastic sediments imply overall low uplift and erosion rates until the Present, favourable to morphological and lithological resistance effects in the landscapes. However, slope instabilities are not uncommon, locally leading to well characterized processes, landforms and deposits of gullying and mass wasting. Therefore, hazards related with slope processes never may be neglected, although only small scale events were recorded in recent times, and times of recurrence of larger events are probably much longer than the historic times.",

    "abstract_s":"Neotectonic movements have been proposed in the literature in order to explain some landforms of the equatorial, passive margin of northeastern Brazil. Its seismo-tectonic activity is concentrated in a few sectors located on or near the coast. Active or recently active structures are mainly identified in Neogene deposits. Identifying a contribution of neotectonics to the morphogeny is difficult in a context where most major morphostructural patterns are explained by Cretaceous tectonics related to oceanic opening and by differential erosion induced by Tertiary epeirogenic uplift. We aim to assess the nature of features considered as possibly neotectonic in origin. Seismogenic faults are not related to significant topographic breaks, except on the coast, where they usually reach only a few meters in height. A study of landforms located near zones of seismo-tectonic activity indicates a possible, probably weak, contribution of neotectonics to the formation of a few high scarps. These scarps occur along or near fault zones reactivated in Cretaceous times. We conclude that neotectonic movements are the result of ongoing deformation along predominantly strike-slip fault zones, with long term deformation rates similar to those recorded by dated landmarks (0.01 mm.yr-1). Despite reported deformation rates that can amount in places to 0.4 mm.yr-1, neotectonic rates are lower than erosion rates. The consequence is that major structural landforms in the region mainly originated in Cretaceous to early Tertiary events.",

The modes and rates of relief inversion that lead the upper layers of the Araripe basin to their culminating position are examined in relation with geological structure and regional uplift, through the presentation and discussion of morphostructural patterns and types of escarpments, differential erosion landforms, soil sequences, modalities of scarp retreat, and possible differential vertical movements (tectonic inversion). The geomorphic and pedological contrast between the plateau (a near-structural surface covered by Ferralsols) and its lower surroundings (either an exhumed Pre-Cenomanian paleosurface covered by Plinthosols, or lower surfaces with relatively immature soils of Luvisol type, often associated with Leptosols) is explained through a study of the evolution of the cuesta-like scarps or glints and outliers that fringe the chapada above sedimentary depressions and basement surfaces. A reconstruction of the conditions and chronology of relief inversion and corresponding area reduction is proposed, according to principles and methods of morphostratigraphy and morphopedology. It brings elements for discussing recently published models of episodic burial and exhumation history, based upon interpretations of thermochronological data obtained in nearby regions. This discussion also bears strong implications about long-term landform evolution in northeast Brazil and other passive margin areas. From a more general point of view, the present work is considered as a case study for analysing processes and rates of vertical erosion and scarp retreat in tropical tabular structures and sandstone plateaus.",

    "abstract_s":"Usually known as prone to severe droughts, the inner Northeast Brazil (“sertão”) is still hardly considered as an area of hazards and risks related to violent geodynamic events. However, such past or present phenomena are now recognized in a few narrow humid mountains exposed to the trade-winds, such as the eastern “Chapada do Araripe”, a high tabular sandstone plateau located at the border between the Ceará and Pernambuco states. Here, a 400-500 m high cuesta-like scarp covered by a dense forest overlooks drier dissected lowlands. The city of Crato (110,000 inhabitants) is built along one of its short rivers, the Rio Grangeiro, 4 km from the rim. Whereas existing works only bear on current and historically observed dynamics, flash-floods, gullying, and small-scale mass movements, we consider a wider range of geodynamic phenomena. So far, only the violent floods that periodically occur along the Grangeiro River have been taken into account in urban management, with the construction of a 2 km long concrete channel through the city. According to our analysis of climate-hydrological data over the last decade, big floods aggravated by this inadequate canalization have devastated the centre almost every year. Our study of landforms and deposits in the city and upstream also evidences largely distributed marks of past large-scale mass movements, debris flows, landslides, and even Sturzstrom. We show the importance of recurrent gravitational dynamics as usual processes in scarp evolution. Since such phenomena induced by favourable climatic and geological factors still might occur in a now densely populated area, and since some of them were catastrophic, they must be included in natural hazards and risks, in spite of the current lack of data on their chronology. Our first results justify further integrated studies of the past and current conditions of occurrence of both high frequency-low magnitude, and low frequency-extreme events identified through short-and long-terms records.",

We analyse the mechanisms of relief inversion in the Araripe sedimentary basin in relation with local or regional crustal upwarp, in the light of original field and cartographic data. The contrast between the plateau – a near-structural surface – and the surrounding depressions is explained through a study of the erosion scarps that fringe the chapada above sedimentary depressions (east, southwest: segments with cuesta-like landforms and wide inland “peripheric” depressions; cuesta-like landforms and deep box-valleys without wide depressions) or basement surfaces (north, west, south: glints and outliers). No evidence of tectonic inversion is found. Sapping, landslides and other mass movements appear as common processes of relief inversion and scarp retreat, the rates and results of which appear to be controlled by sediment litholoy and paleolandforms of the rifted basement. Geometric relationships with regional stepped surfaces, in particular the low Sertaneja Surface, and exhumed paleosurfaces are analysed. Our estimation of the amplitude of relief inversion (0.6-0.7 km) differs significantly from AFT-derived estimates reported from Palaeozoic and Mesozoic sandstones, which would imply burial by a considerable thickness of younger section and, later, 1.5 km of post-rift denudation. The exhumation of surrounding basement surfaces probably began very early, as shown to the northwest of the chapada by the presence of widespread Palaeogene laterites. A later stage of basin topographic inversion, in the Oligocene and later, would correspond to the major stages of river incision, partial planation and basin inversion.",

    "abstract_s":"Steep slopes form the marginal scarp of the semi-arid northern Brazilian “Nordeste” and bound inner residual plateaus and ridges rising up to 800-1,200 m. They overlook a low pediplain merging seaward with a well developed coastal erosional-gradational piedmont. Only a few of them coincide with geological contacts and\/or fault zones. Their location, their straight or sinuous outlines, and the presence or lack of residual landforms in front of them give indications on their origin and evolution. Dissected pediments and sparse debris fans visible at the base of some escarpments suggest recent erosive activity and possible slope retreat, although most of these forms are decoupled from major valleys. In order to understand scarp morphology and evolution in a context where various factors (lithology, neotectonics, climatic and eustatic changes) can be considered, we describe the morphostructural patterns of chosen escarpments, as well as the morphodynamic conditions of their evolution since the Neogene. Only a few scarps retained in our study show strong structural control. It could not be determined in all cases whether they are residual or active fault scarps, or fault-line scarps. Most of them, straight or sinuous, controlled or not by local structures, are mainly inherited landforms, initiated during the Cretaceous rifting (south of the Potiguar basin) or later. The Neogene clastic sedimentation on the piedmonts and on coastal areas probably reflect the occurrence of dry periods inducing widespread stripping of deep soil horizons and erosion of bare rock slopes and surfaces, even without tectonic forcing. Dissection stages occurred in periods of more humid climate and\/or low sea level. Only slight or local backwearing of slopes occurred, associated with downwearing on pediments, probably in diachronic ways. The moderate volumes of Neogene clastic sediments imply overall low uplift and erosion rates until the Present, still to be more precisely quantified, and favourable to morphological and lithological resistance effects in the landscapes.",

Belonging to an Early Cretaceous intracontinental rift shoulder and to the northern marginal scarp of the Brazilian “Nordeste”, this high plateau is suspected to be a residual relief preserved above a low regional planation surface (the Sertaneja pediplain) and the coastal piedmont, but tectonic controls on several of its outer border scarps cannot be excluded. In order to explain its outstanding position, we use a methodology consisting in integration of a wide set of digital data (SRTM DEM, geological maps, Landsat imagery, etc.) in a Geographic Information System that appears as a relevant technique to compare topographic features with geological structure. The results of the detailed morphostructural mapping reveal that differential erosion has played a predominant role in the geomorphic outlines of the Baturité massif. These observations confirm the incompatibility of important neotectonic movements in the relief differentiation. When replaced in its regional morphotectonic context, they rather suggest the partial preservation of the northwest shoulder of the Neocomian Potiguar rift, giving new constraints for a relevant modelling of the regional morphotectonic evolution.",

Its relief reflects a complex geological history in which the most significant events are the Early Cretaceous rifting, followed by unequal post-rift subsidence, transform oceanic opening (Aptian-Albian), and formation of the margin, with differentiated evolution of compartments inherited from rifting and break-up patterns. On the basis of morphostructural data and of published stratigraphic and thermochronometric results, we propose a reconstruction of its evolution, illustrated by a series of sketch block-diagrammes, and an evaluation of the uplift and erosion values and rates. Through an analysis of the roles of tectono-eustatic controls and morphotectonic-climatic couplings, it offers new insights on the influence of superposed structural legacies in the geomorphic development and lateral variations of marginal escarpments. From our observations, northeastern Brazil appears as an ideal place for calibrating results of low temperature thermochronometry and for developing new conceptual models of morphotectonic evolution of passive margins and marginal scarps.",

    "abstract_s":"Physico-chemical characterization of lead, zinc and cadmium has been carried out on eight samples from both separate and combined sewers. Dissolved and particulate total metal levels have been determined. A speciation scheme has been used ta further divide these phases in two dissolved fractions, bioavailable and stable, and five particulate fractions, ion-exchangeable, acid-soluble, reducible, oxidizable and residual. TotaJ dissolved lead concentrations were found ta be largely below European Community (EC) directives for drinking water production. Lead was represented by stable forms while zinc and cadmium were mainly bioavailable. Particulate concentrations were higher than naturallevels found in the Seine-Nolmandie basin. Zinc was characteristic for municipal effluents, and lead and cadmium were more concentrated in separate sewers. Correlations have been observed between particulate heavy metals and volatile matter on the ring highway, or with iron at the Savigny site. The particulate meral speciation scheme has demonstrated the important dependence of heavy metal distribution on the sampling site, as weil as the potentially more mobile nature of zinc and cadmium, compared to that of lead. The structural modifications undergone by solids during their transport along the sewer networks had a significant impact on particulate metal mobility. This has been clearly noted for lead, whose mobility decreased from upstream ta downstream in the studied system.",

Milled samples were annealed for 30 min in a vacuum at different temperatures (T A) between 700 and 1190 • C. The effects of heat treatment and Mo content on struc-tural and magnetic property changes have been investigated by means of x-ray diffraction using the Rietveld method, transmission electron microscopy and magnetic measurements. For samples annealed at T A > 900 • C the tetragonal ThMn 12 -type structure is identified, while for 700 < T A <900 • C a new out of equilibrium P 6\/mmm type structure was found as the major phase. This novel nanocrystalline phase has never been synthesized before. The correspondent stoichiometry is determined on the basis of the vacancy model. The Rietveld analysis gives a stoichiometry ratio equal to 1:10, for the out of equilibrium hexagonal phase, which is described with three crystallographic transition metal sites: 3g is fully occupied, 6l occupation is limited to hexagons surrounding the Fe dumbbell pairs 2e. We have performed a magnetic and structural study of nanocrystalline metastable P 6\/mmm Sm(Fe 1−x Mo x) 10 , correlated to structural transformation towards its equilibrium derivative I4\/mmm Sm(Fe 1−x Mo x) 12 . A maximum of the coercive field H C (H C > 5 kOe) has been observed for the new hexagonal P 6\/mmm phase suggesting that nanocrystalline Sm(Fe,Mo) 10 , is a semi-hard material, and is potential candidate for magnetic recording.",

The present work aims at elaborating an incremental–iterative numerical method for voxel-based modeling of damage evolution in quasi-brittle microstructures. The iterative scheme based on the Lippmann–Schwinger equation in the real space domain (Yvonnet, in Int J Numer Methods Eng 92:178–205, 2012) is first cast into an incremental form so as to implement nonlinear material models efficiently. In the proposed scheme, local strain increments at material grid points are computed iteratively by a mapping operation through a transformation array, while local stresses are determined using a constitutive model that accounts for material degradation by damage. For validation, benchmark studies and numerical simulations using microtomographic data of concrete are performed. For each test, numerical predictions by the incremental–iterative scheme and the finite element method, respectively, are presented and compared for both global responses and local damage distributions. It is emphasized that the proposed incremental–iterative formulation can be straightforwardly applied in the framework of other Lippmann–Schwinger equation-based schemes, like the fast Fourier transform method.",

    "abstract_s":"Many blockstreams occur in the Miocene volcanic area of Mont Mézenc, eastern Velay, SE Massif Central, France. They were supplied by frost-shattered exposures of lava-flow boundaries, phonolitic domes and other intrusions. These ‘rivers of rock’ are ribbons of chaotically upheaved blocks presenting an openwork structure, are 400 to 1100 m long and 20 to 200 m wide, and are today disconnected from the rock exposures that supplied the debris. Some occur on very low gradient slopes. The largest blockstreams offer evidence of compression ridges and post-depositional block subsidence. Their dynamics and age are not precisely known in the study area and they have been interpreted by default as Late Pleniglacial rock glaciers. Field observations (stratigraphic relations with other surficial deposits, topographic position, distance from bedrock source areas and from talwegs, structural context), however, indicate that the situation is more complex, with new implications for their age, origin and past dynamics. This reconnaissance study proposes a typology of blockstreams for the area. The base of the blockstreams remains inaccessible to direct observation but several ground-penetrating radar transects were carried out in order to map the topography at depth. Results show that the blocks fill gullies 5 to 15 m in depth. At the surface, a sharp textural transition with other slope deposits is clearly detected but the latter grade topographically to the surface of the blockstreams, not to the gullies beneath them. These cross-cutting relations provide a relative chronology not previously established in the case of blockstream deposits.",

Il s’agit de langues de blocs métriques redressés en tous sens, sans matrice en surface, déconnectées des amonts pourvoyeurs (gélifraction) et présentes jusque sur des pentes très faibles. Elles ont souvent été assimilées par défaut à d'anciens glaciers rocheux et rattachées sur la base d’arguments morpho-stratigraphiques au Pléniglaciaire supérieur. Elles sont en fait d’origine et d’âge mal connu et ne répondent pas clairement au modèle classique d’un glacier rocheux de haute montagne. Les observations de terrain (caractères intrinsèques, rapports stratigraphiques avec les autres formations, position dans la topographie, distance aux zones-source, contexte structural...), suggèrent des processus de mise en place par fluage et\/ou lavage qui restent à préciser, la possibilité d’une chenalisation des blocs par la topographie préexistante (ravines), et posent la question de l’âge, de l’efficacité des processus en jeu et de l’existence éventuelle de plusieurs générations. L’acquisition récente de photographies aériennes traitées en photogrammétrie (orthophotographies, MNT) doit permettre de préciser la description de l’organisation de surface (modelé, fabrique) révélatrice des contraintes liées aux processus de mise en place. D'autre part, les investigations géophysiques menées (GPR et tomographie électrique) pourraient apporter d'intéressants éléments de compréhension. Cette étude s’intègre au programme de recherche WRACC, financé par L’Etablissement Public Loire et le FEDER.",

    "abstract_s":"In this paper, we pursue the investigations started in \\cite{Mas-You} where the authors provide a construction of the Dunkl intertwining operator for a large subset of the set of regular multiplicity values. More precisely, we make concrete the action of this operator on homogeneous polynomials when the root system is of dihedral type and under a mild assumption on the multiplicity function. In particular, we obtain a formula for the corresponding Dunkl kernel and another representation of the generalized Bessel function already derived in \\cite{Demni0}. When the multiplicity function is everywhere constant, our computations give a solution to the problem of counting the number of decompositions of an element from a dihedral group into a fixed number of (non necessarily simple) reflections. In the remainder of the paper, we supply another method to derive the Dunkl kernel associated with dihedral systems from the corresponding generalized Bessel function. This time, we use the shift principle together with multiple combinations of Dunkl operators corresponding to the vectors of the canonical basis of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. When the dihedral system is of order six and only in this case, a single combination suffices to get the Dunkl kernel and agrees up to an isomorphism with the formula recently obtained by Amri \\cite[Lemma1]{Amri} in the case of a root system of type $A_2$. We finally derive an integral representation for the Dunkl kernel associated with the dihedral system of order eight.",

    "abstract_s":"This research is focused on the construction and the identification of a stochastic computational model (SCM), using experimental eigenfrequencies and mode shapes measured for a family of real structures exhibiting slight differences that induce variability in the measured quantities. The statistical properties of the SCM are controlled by a set of hyperparameters such as mean values, coefficients of variation, etc. The hyperparameters are identified using the first experimental natural frequencies, and the associated experimental mass-normalized mode shapes measured for the family of real structures. The methodology proposed introduces a random transformation of the computational modal quantities (computational eigenfrequencies and computational mode shapes) in order to make them almost surely in correspondence with the experimental modal data of each measured real structure. Thus this methodology automatically takes into account the mode crossings and mode veerings which can take place between the experimental configurations and the computational realizations of the SCM. Then the hyperparameters are identified using the maximum likelihood method. The proposed methodology is applied to a booster pump of thermal units for which experimental modal data have been measured on several sites.",

The present work is devoted to an industrial application for which the centrifugal stiffening due to rotational effects is also included. The nonlinear mistuned forced response is investigated in the time-domain by using a spatial cyclic load over a given excitation frequency range. The geometric nonlinear mis-tuned analysis is performed over the frequency range by using the Fast-Fourier Transform of the time response. A sensitivity analysis is conducted with respect to the load level, giving rise to secondary resonances, which appear outside the excitation frequency range and which can exhibit a particular sensitivity to uncertainties. Such new complex dynamical situation, induced by the coupling between the geometrical nonlinearities and the mistuning phenomenon, is analyzed in details.",

The discrete values of the effective potential are computed by FEM through random sampling in the parameter space, and NN are used to approximate the surface response and to derive the macroscopic stress and tangent tensor components. We show through several numerical convergence analyses that smooth functions can be efficiently evaluated in parameter spaces with dimension up to 10, allowing to consider 3D Representative Volume Elements (RVE) and an explicit dependence of the effective behavior on microstructural parameters like volume fraction.

    "abstract_s":"A drillstring is a long column under rotation, composed by a sequence of connected drill-pipes and auxiliary equipment, which is used to drill the soil in oil prospecting. During its operation, this column presents a three-dimensional dynamics, subjected to longitudinal, lateral, and torsional vibrations, besides the effects of friction, shock, and bit-rock interaction. The study of the dynamics of this equipment is very important in many engineering applications, especially to reduce costs in the oil exploration process. In this sense, this work aims to formulate and solve a robust optimization problem that seeks to maximize horizontal drillstrings rate of penetration into of the soil, subjected to the restriction imposed by the structural limits of the column. To analyze the nonlinear dynamics of drillstrings in horizontal configuration, a computational model, which uses a nonlinear beam theory of Timoshenko type is considered. This model also takes into account the effects of friction and shock, induced by the lateral impacts between the drill-string and borehole wall, as well as bit-rock interaction effects. The uncertainties of the bit-rock interaction model are taken into account using a parametric probabilistic approach. Two optimizations problems (one deterministic and one robust), where the objective is to maximize the drillstring rate of penetration (ROP) into the soil, respecting its structural limits, are formulated and solved. In order to optimize the ROP, it is possible to vary the drillstring velocities of translation and rotation. The solutions of these optimization problems provided two different strategies to maximize the ROP.",

This paper provides a complete methodology to take into account and analyse such uncertainties.

    "abstract_s":"Directionally solidified eutectic (DSE) ceramics add new potentialities to the advantages of sintered ceramics: a higher strength, almost constant, up to temperatures close to the melting point and a better creep resistance. The microstructure of melt-growth composites (MGC) of ceramic oxides consists in three-dimensional and continuous interconnected networks of single-crystal eutectic phases. After solidification of binary eutectics, the eutectic phases are alumina and either a perovskite or garnet phase. In ternary systems, cubic zirconia is added as a third phase. For very high temperature structural applications such as turbine blades in future aeronautical turbines or thermal power generation systems, the investigation is focused on both binary (Al2O3-Y3Al5O12 (YAG), Al2O3-Er3Al5O12 (EAG) and Al2O3-GdAlO3 (GAP)) and ternary (Al2O3-YAG-ZrO2, Al2O3-EAG-ZrO2 and Al2O3-GAP-ZrO2) eutectics. Improving the strength and toughness of DSE ceramics being essential for such practical applications, results concerning the mechanical behavior of these eutectics will be reported after a short presentation concerning microstructure and crystallography. This better knowledge of DSE ceramics has led to the development of a specific Bridgman furnace to produce large crystals and investigate possible applications of DSE ceramics to a new generation of very high temperature gas turbines, e.g. hollow non-cooled nozzles, turbine blades or combustor liner panels.",

    "abstract_s":"A drillstring is a long column under rotation, composed by a sequence of connected drill-pipes and auxiliary equipment, which is used to drill the soil in oil prospecting. During its operation, this column presents a three-dimensional dynamics, subjected to longitudinal, lateral, and torsional vibrations, besides the effects of friction, shock, and bit-rock interaction. Due to the relevance of this equipment in some engineering applications, this work aims to analyze the nonlinear dynamics of drillstrings in horizontal configuration. A computational model, which uses a nonlinear beam theory of Timoshenko type that takes into account the coupling between longitudinal, transverse, and torsional vibrations, is considered. This model also takes into account the effects of friction and shock, induced by the lateral impacts between the drillstring and borehole wall, as well as bit-rock interaction effects. The uncertainties of the bit-rock interaction model are taken into account using a parametric probabilistic approach. Numerical simulations have shown that the mechanical system of interest has a very rich dynamics, which reproduces phenomena such as bit-bounce, stick-slip, and transverse impacts. Two optimizations problems (one deterministic and one robust), where the objective is to maximize the drillstring rate of penetration (ROP) into the soil, respecting its structural limits, are formulated and solved. In order to optimize the ROP, it is possible to vary the drillstring velocities of translation and rotation. The solutions of these optimization problems provided two different strategies to maximize the ROP.",

    "title_s":"Genetic and functional analyses demonstrate a role for abnormal glycinergic signaling in autism",
    "abstract_s":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition characterized by marked genetic heterogeneity. Recent studies of rare structural and sequence variants have identified hundreds of loci involved in ASD, but our knowledge of the overall genetic architecture and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remains incomplete. Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are ligand-gated chloride channels that mediate inhibitory neurotransmission in the adult nervous system but exert an excitatory action in immature neurons. GlyRs containing the α2 subunit are highly expressed in the embryonic brain, where they promote cortical interneuron migration and the generation of excitatory projection neurons. We previously identified a rare microdeletion of the X-linked gene GLRA2, encoding the GlyR α2 subunit, in a boy with autism. The microdeletion removes the terminal exons of the gene (GLRA2Δex8-9). Here, we sequenced 400 males with ASD and identified one de novo missense mutation, p.R153Q, absent from controls. In vitro functional analysis demonstrated that the GLRA2Δex8-9 protein failed to localize to the cell membrane, while the R153Q mutation impaired surface expression and markedly reduced sensitivity to glycine. Very recently, an additional de novo missense mutation (p.N136S) was reported in a boy with ASD, and we show that this mutation also reduced cell-surface expression and glycine sensitivity. Targeted glra2 knockdown in zebrafish induced severe axon-branching defects, rescued by injection of wild type but not GLRA2Δex8-9 or R153Q transcripts, providing further evidence for their loss-of-function effect. Glra2 knockout mice exhibited deficits in object recognition memory and impaired long-term potentiation in the prefrontal cortex. Taken together, these results implicate GLRA2 in non-syndromic ASD, unveil a novel role for GLRA2 in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory, and link altered glycinergic signaling to social and cognitive impairments.",

    "abstract_s":"In this work, a formulation is developed within the phase field method for mod-eling interactions between interfacial damage and bulk brittle cracking in complex microstructures. The method is dedicated to voxel-based models of highly complex microstructures, as obtained from X-ray microtomography images. A smoothed displacement jump approximation is introduced by means of level-set functions to overcome the issue of pixelized interfaces in voxel-based models. A simple technique is proposed to construct the level-set function in that case. Compared to recent work aiming at modeling cohesive cracks within the phase field method, our framework differs in several points: the formulation is such that interfaces are not initially damaged; no additional variables are required to describe the discontinuities at the interface and fatigue cracks can be modeled. The technique allows interaction between bulk and interface cracks, e.g. nucleation from interfaces and propagation within the matrix, and for arbitrary geometries and interactions between cracks. Several benchmarks are presented to validate the model. The technique is illustrated through numerical examples involving complex microcracking in X-ray CT image-based models of concrete microstructures.",

    "abstract_s":"In the homogenization setting, the effective properties of a heterogeneous material can be retrieved from the solution of the so-called corrector problem. In some cases of practical interest, obtaining such a solution remains a challenging computational task requiring an extremely fine discretization of microstructural features. In this context, Bignonnet et al. recently proposed a framework where smooth mesoscopic elasticity random fields are defined through a filtering procedure. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of information-theoretic random field models to accurately represent such mesoscopic elasticity fields. The aim is to substantially reduce the homogenization cost through the use of coarser discretizations while solving mesoscale corrector problems. The analysis is performed on a simple but non-trivial model microstructure. First of all, we recall the theoretical background related to the filtering and multiscale frameworks, and subsequently characterize some statistical properties of the filtered stiffness field. Based on these properties, we further introduce a random field model and address its calibration through statistical estimators and the maximum likelihood principle. Finally, the validation of the model is discussed by comparing some quantities of interest that are obtained either from numerical experiments on the underlying random microstructure or from model-based simulations. It is shown that for the case under study, the information-theoretic model can be calibrated with a limited set of realizations and still allows for accurate predictions of the effective properties.",

    "abstract_s":"The mobility during winter season in France mainly relies on the use of de-icers, with an amount ranging from two hundreds thousands tons up to two millions tons for the roads only. Besides the economic impact, there are many concerns on their environmental and infrastructure, both on roads and on airports. In such context and in the framework of the R5G (5th Generation Road) project driven by IFSTTAR, investigations were carried out on the way to modify the infrastructure to maintain pavement surface at a temperature above water freezing point. Two distinct approaches, that can could be combined, were selected. The first one consisted in having a heated fluid circulating in a porous layer within an asphalt concrete pavement sample. The second one specifically relied on the use of paraffin phase change materials (PCM) in cement concrete pavement ones. Experiments on enhanced pavement samples were conducted in a climatic chamber to simulate winter conditions for several continuous days, including wind and precipitations, and monitored by infrared thermography. Studies concerning the first approach consisted in identifying the temperature range of the fluid to maintain asphalt concrete surface freezing-free. Both experimental and numerical approaches were conducted showing the importance of the role of the hydraulic conductivity of the porous layer. The analysis of infrared images indicated a surface temperature above freezing excepted in one situation, for which cold air convection and precipitations were combined at pavement surface. A temperature gradient along the surface was also observed. A good agreement was found between numerical and experimental results. To moderate the effect of precipitation, several PCM insertions were chosen and inserted at different depths, with various volumes and packaging (liquid, or powder of encapsulated liquid paraffin). At this stage of the study, rather mixed results were obtained. Delay in the surface ice formation was not conclusive, probably due to deeper location and an unsufficient amount of PCM used. Further investigation to carry out by coupling numerical and experimental approaches would help in refining the use of PCM for this application. The proposed paper will address the presentation of infrared monitoring developed during these studies. (a) (b) (c) (d)",

    "abstract_s":"On 16 October 1979, a tsunami of a local origin hits the French Riviera around Nice, France, killing 8 people and generating important economic losses. Its impact was felt from Hyères to Menton, France. The main effect of this tsunami was flooding in the neighborhoods of La Salis and La Garoupe, Antibes, France. A synthesis of unpublished reports written in the context of an administrative investigation was conducted. Various archives were also consulted (newspapers, fire and rescue unit reports, insurance reports, etc.), and a field survey was organized in 2009 to record testimonies from the inhabitants who witnessed the flood in La Salis, Antibes, the area where the effects of the tsunami were the greatest. A geo-database of the neighborhood of La Salis was built using available aerial imagery, land cover data and digital terrain models, to reconstruct the surface of the flooded area as it was in 1979 and as it is now. Comparing precise testimonies and the 1979 topographic information available allowed the authors to precisely map the flood and to deduce the runup values which reached 3.5 m locally, with a maximal distance of flooding of 150 m inland. This paper provides modelers with precious information about the extent of flooding and the time sequence in order to reconstitute the propagation and flooding of the 16 October 1979 tsunami. This information highlights the fact that the French Riviera is a low hazard, but high vulnerability area.",

    "title_s":"Modeling and uncertainty quantification in the nonlinear stochastic dynamics of horizontal drillstrings",
    "abstract_s":"Oil prospecting uses an equipment called drillstring to drill the soil until the reservoir level. This equipment is a long column under rotation, composed by a sequence of connected drill-pipes and auxiliary equipment. The dynamics of this column is very complex because, under normal operational conditions, it is subjected to longitudinal, lateral, and torsional vibrations, which presents a nonlinear coupling. Also, this structure is subjected to friction and shocks effects due to the mechanical contacts between the pairs drill-bit\/soil and drill-pipes\/borehole. This work presents a mechanical-mathematical model to analyze a drillstring in horizontal configuration. This model uses a beam theory which accounts rotatory inertia, shear deformation, and the nonlinear coupling between three mechanisms of vibration. The model equations are discretized using the finite element method. The uncertainties in bit-rock interaction model parameters are taken into account through a parametric probabilistic approach, and the random parameters probability distributions are constructed by means of maximum entropy principle. Numerical simulations are conducted in order to characterize the nonlinear dynamic behavior of the structure, specially, the drill-bit. Dynamical phenomena inherently nonlinear, such as slick-slip and bit-bounce, are observed in the simulations, as well as shocks. A spectral analysis shows, surprisingly, that slick-slip and bit-bounce phenomena result from the lateral vibration mechanism, and that shock phenomena comes from the torsional vibration. Seeking to increase the efficiency of the drilling process, an optimization problem that aims to maximize the rate of penetration of the column into the soil, respecting its structural limits, is proposed and solved",

    "abstract_s":"In the last few years, evidence theory, also known as Dempster-Shafer theory or belief functions theory, have received growing attention in many fields such as artificial intelligence, computer vision, telecommunications and networks, robotics, and finance. This is due to the fact that imperfect information permeates the real-world applications, and as a result, it must be incorporated into any information system that aims to provide a complete and accurate model of the real world. Although, it is in an early stage of development relative to classical probability theory, evidence theory has proved to be particularly useful to represent and reason with imperfect information in a wide range of real-world applications. In such cases, evidence theory provides a flexible framework for handling and mining uncertainty and imprecision as well as combining evidence obtained from multiple sources and modeling the conflict between them. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, it introduces the basics of the belief functions theory with emphasis on the transferable belief model. Second, it provides a practical case study to show how the belief functions theory was used in a real network application, thereby providing guidelines for how the evidence theory may be used in telecommunications and networks. Lastly, it surveys and discusses a number of examples of applications of the evidence theory in telecommunications and network technologies.",

    "abstract_s":"In the last few years, Dempster–Shafer theory also known as Theory of Belief Functions (TBF) or Evidence theory has received growing attention in many fields of applications such as finance, technology, biomedicine, etc. This theory may be seen as a generalization framework of different instances such as probability, fuzzy sets, and possibility theories. Using Dempster–Shafer belief functions to express available information allows considering two kinds of uncertainty: aleatory uncertainty due to the variability of the variable of interest in the population and epistemic uncertainty due to a lack of knowledge on the state of the variable. Different sources of uncertainty and imprecision may arise in network and telecommunication domains. Such imperfection may be due to imprecision of many aspects regarding the environment: signal, data link, network, etc. For example, it may be due to communication links that might be unreliable, either due to operational tolerance levels or environmental factors. As detailed in the survey paper proposed par Mustapha Reda Senouci, Abdelhamid Mellouk, Mohamed Abdelkrim Senouci, and Latifa Oukhellou in this special issue, the Theory of Belief Functions has proved to be particularly useful to represent and reason with partial information in a wide range of applications, including signal processing, coding, supervision, localization, resource provisioning, etc. In such case, the belief function theory provides a flexible framework for handling and mining imprecision and uncertainty as well as combining different disparate evidence about uncertain events. Indeed, this theory allows modeling different concepts such as imprecision, ambiguity, and ignorance. Also, a variety of combination operators is available in the fusion process. This special issue of Annals of Telecommunications is intended to provide the recent advances on the use of the Theory of Belief Functions and machine learning approaches in telecommunication and network technologies. It focused on how belief functions and machine learning have affected different aspects (protocols, algorithms, paradigm, energy, signal coding, etc.) for a large family of applications (healthcare, medical, underwater, vehicular, robotic, etc.) using network technologies (sensor networks, MANET, VANET, etc.).",

    "abstract_s":"Triple therapy combining a protease inhibitor (PI) (telaprevir or boceprevir), pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN), and ribavirin (RBV) has dramatically increased the chance of eradicating hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, the efficacy of this treatment remains suboptimal in cirrhotic treatment-experienced patients. Here, we aimed to better understand the origin of this impaired response by estimating the antiviral effectiveness of each drug. Fifteen HCV genotype 1-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis, who were nonresponders to prior PEG-IFN\/RBV therapy, were enrolled in a nonrandomized study. HCV RNA and concentrations of PIs, PEG-IFN, and RBV were frequently assessed in the first 12 weeks of treatment and were analyzed using a pharmacokinetic\/viral kinetic model. The two PIs achieved similar levels of molar concentrations (P = 0.5), but there was a significant difference in the 50% effective concentrations (EC50) (P = 0.008), leading to greater effectiveness for telaprevir than for boceprevir in blocking viral production (99.8% versus 99.0%, respectively, P = 0.002). In all patients, the antiviral effectiveness of PEG-IFN was modest (43.4%), and there was no significant contribution of RBV exposure to the total antiviral effectiveness. The second phase of viral decline, which is attributed to the loss rate of infected cells, was slow (0.19 day(-1)) and was higher in patients who subsequently eradicated HCV (P = 0.03). The two PIs achieved high levels of antiviral effectiveness. However, the suboptimal antiviral effectiveness of PEG-IFN\/RBV and the low loss of infected cells suggest that a longer treatment duration might be needed in cirrhotic treatment-experienced patients and that a future IFN-free regimen may be particularly beneficial in these patients.",

In keeping with standard spatial discretization methods (e.g., finite elements), the process is discrete. It is further required to exhibit a specified mean, standard deviation, and a global measure of the correlation length. The specification of the random process is completed by imposing that it yields a maximum of the entropy. If no constraint on the sign of the process exists, the maximum entropy is achieved for a Gaussian process the autocorrelation of which is constructed. The case of a positive process is considered next and an algorithm is formulated to simulate the non-Gaussian process yielding the maximum entropy. In the second part of the paper, this non-Gaussian model is used to represent the uncertain friction coefficient in a simple, lumped mass model of an elastic structure resting on a frictional support. The dynamic response of this uncertain system to a random excitation at its end is studied, focusing in particular on the occurrence of slip and stick.",

    "abstract_s":"Many recent and often adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are associated in practice to unknown rates of convergence. We propose a simulation-based methodology to estimate MCMC efficiency, grounded on a Kullback divergence criterion requiring an estimate of the entropy of the algorithm successive densities, computed from iid simulated chains. We recently proved in Chauveau and Vandekerkhove (2013) some consistency results in MCMC setup for an entropy estimate based on Monte-Carlo integration of a kernel density estimate based on Györfi and Van Der Meulen (1989). Since this estimate requires some tuning parameters and deteriorates as dimension increases, we investigate here an alternative estimation technique based on Nearest Neighbor estimates. This approach has been initiated by Kozachenko and Leonenko (1987) but used mostly in univariate situations until recently when entropy estimation has been considered in other fields like neuroscience. Theoretically, we prove that, under certain uniform control conditions, the successive densities of a generic class of Adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algorithms to which most of the strategies proposed in the recent literature belong can be estimated consistently with our method. We then show that in MCMC setup where moderate to large dimensions are common, this estimate seems appealing for both computational and operational considerations, and that the problem inherent to a non neglictible bias arising in high dimension can be overcome. All our algorithms for MCMC simulation and entropy estimation are implemented in an R package taking advantage of recent advances in high performance (parallel) computing.",

The accelerogram is modeled by a time series represented by a random vector in high dimension. The specifications related to the accelerograms are directly taken into account in the construction of the probability distribution of this random vector by using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) principle under constraints defined by an appropriate available information. A new algorithm, adapted to the high stochastic dimension, is proposed to identify the Lagrange multipliers introduced in the MaxEnt principle to take into account the constraints. This algorithm is based on (1) the minimization of an appropriate convex functional and (2) the construction of the probability distribution defined as the invariant measure of an Itô Stochastic Differential Equation in order to estimate the integrals in high dimension of the problem. The algorithm is validated through an application for which the available information is related to the envelop of the accelerogram, statistics on the response spectrum, statistics on the Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA), statistics on the Cumulative Absolute Velocity (CAV), statistics on the Arias Intensity (AI), the end-velocity and the end-displacement.",

In graph-based frameworks, such operators basically rely on symmetric adjacency relations between pixels. In this article, we introduce a notion of directed connected operators for hierarchical image processing, by also considering non-symmetric adjacency relations. The induced image representation models are no longer partition hierarchies (i.e., trees), but directed acyclic graphs that generalize standard morphological tree structures such as component trees, binary partition trees or hierarchical watersheds. We describe how to efficiently build and handle these richer data structures, and we illustrate the versatility of the proposed framework in image filtering and image segmentation.",

    "abstract_s":"Parallelism is becoming more important nowadays due to the increasing use of multiprocessor systems. In this paper, we study the problem of scheduling periodic parallel real-time Directed Acyclic graph (DAG) tasks on m homogeneous multiprocessor systems. A DAG task is an example of inter-subtask parallelism. It consists of a collection of dependent subtasks under precedence constraints. The dependencies between subtasks make scheduling process more challenging. We propose a stretching algorithm applied on each DAG tasks to transform them into a set of independent sequential threads with intermediate offsets and deadlines. The threads obtained with the transformation are two types, (i) fully-stretched master threads with utilization equal to 1 and (ii) constrained-deadline independent threads. The fully-stretched master threads are assigned to dedicated processors and the remaining processors m' ≤ m, are scheduled using global EDF scheduling algorithm. Then, we prove that preemptive global EDF scheduling of stretched threads has a resource augmentation bound equal to (3+ √ 5)\/2 for all tasksets with n < ϕ * m , where n is the number of tasks in the taskset and ϕ is the golden ratio 1 .",

However, since these are long-ranged and fast decreasing interactions, hierarchical algorithms like the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) are well suited for their fast evaluation. The relatively low accuracy required for the interaction forces between dislocations brought us to develop a more efficient approximation method for the farfield. On the other hand, the nearfield interactions are still evaluated analytically, which required a rather performant implementation (AVX, GPU...). Regarding parallelism, our code benefits from a hybrid OpenMP\/MPI paradigm and a cache-conscious data structure. Finally, an accurate handling of topological elements intersecting the structure of the octree was considered. The latter feature implied careful modifications of the P2M\/L2P operators in order to deal with shared memory model of parallelism.",

The computation of the internal elastic forces is by far the most resources consuming step in DD simulations, which is even more true for anisotropic elasticity in the absence of explicit Green's function. L. Dupuy, J. Soulacroix and M. Fivel showed that the approaches based on Willis-Steed-Lothe or Brown formulae can be accelerated using spherical harmonics expansions of the Stroh matrices. This feature was implemented in the DD code OptiDis in order to power the anisotropic forces computation.

Such an issue typically arises in uncertainty quantification for complex systems, where the input coefficients associated with the elliptic operators must be identified by solving statistical inverse problems. Specifically, we consider the case of non-Gaussian random fields with values in some arbitrary bounded or semi-bounded subsets of R^n. The approach involves two main features. The first one is the construction of a family of random fields converging, at a user-controlled rate, towards the target random field. Each of these auxialiary random fields can be subsequently simulated by solving a family of Itô stochastic differential equations. The second ingredient is the definition of an adaptive discretization algorithm. The latter allows refining the integration step on-the-fly and prevents the scheme from diverging. The proposed strategy is finally exemplified on three examples, each of which serving as a benchmark, either for the adaptivity procedure or for the convergence of the diffusions.",

    "abstract_s":"In this paper, we focus on the semi-partitioned scheduling of sporadic tasks with constrained deadlines and identical processors. We study two cases of semi-partitioning: (i) the case where the worst case execution time (WCET) of a job can be portioned, each portion being executed on a dedicated processor, according to a static pattern of migration; (ii) the case where the jobs of a task are released on a processor, 1 time out of p, where p is an integer at most equal to the number of processors, according to a round-robin migration pattern. The first approach has been investigated in the state-of-the-art by migrating a job at its local deadline, computed from the deadline of the task it belongs to. We study several local deadline assignment heuristics (fair, based on processor utilization and based on the minimum acceptable local deadline for a job on a processor). In both cases, we propose feasibility conditions for the schedulability of sporadic tasks scheduled using earliest deadline first (EDF) semi-partitioned scheduling. We show that the load function used for global scheduling to establish the feasibility of sporadic task sets exhibits interesting properties in the semi-partitioning context. We carry out simulations to study the performance of the two approaches in terms of success rate and number of migrations, for platforms composed of four and eight processors. We compare the performance of these semi-partitioned heuristics with the performance of classical partitioned scheduling algorithms and with a global scheduling heuristic which is currently considered to have good performances.",

In the scope of the ANR (Agence Nationale pour la Recherche)\/TeRSan (Terminology and Data Elements Repositories for Healthcare Interoperability) project, we propose to set and use a semantic interoperability platform, based on semantic web technologies, in order to facilitate standardized healthcare information exchanges between heterogeneous Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs) in different care settings. Material and methods: The platform is a standard-based expressive and scalable semantic interoperability framework. It includes centrally managed Common Data Elements bounded to international\/national reference terminologies such as ICD10, CCAM, SNOMED CT, ICD-O, LOINC and PathLex. It offers semantic services such as dynamic mappings between reference and local terminologies. Results: A pilot implementation of semantic services was developed and evaluated within an HIE prototype in telepathology for remote expert advice. The semantic services developed for transcoding local terms into reference terms take into account the type of message and the exchange context defined within standard-based integration profiles. Conclusion: The TeRSan platform is an innovative semantic interoperability framework that (1) provides standard-based semantic services applicable to any HIE infrastructure and (2) preserves the use of local terminologies and local models by end users (health professionals' priority).",

Simultaneously, several research works showed the interest of using multifractal analysis for the description of homogeneous textures in images. In this context, the goal of the present contribution is to study the benefits of using the wavelet leader based multifractal formalism to characterize paintings. After a brief review of the underlying key theoretical concepts, methods and tools, two sets of digitized paintings are analyzed. The first one, the Princeton Experiment, consists of a set of seven paintings and their replicas, made by the same artist. It enables examination of the potential of multifractal analysis in forgery detection. The second one is composed of paintings by Van Gogh and contemporaries, made available by the Van Gogh and Kroller- Muller Museums (Netherlands) in the framework of the ¨ Image processing for Art Investigation research program. It enables us to show various differences in the regularity of textures of Van Gogh’s paintings from different periods, or between Van Gogh’s and contemporaries’ paintings. These preliminary results plead for the constitution of interdisciplinary research teams consisting of experts in art, image processing, mathematics and computer sciences.",

All-cause and cause-specific HRs were estimated using Cox's regression models adjusted for the occupational class at the beginning of the follow-up, the current occupational class, the transition rates between occupational categories and the duration of time spent in occupational categories. Results An increase in the time spent in the clerk class increased men and women's cardiovascular mortality risk compared with that in the upper class (HRs=1.59 (1.14 to 2.20) and 2.65 (1.14 to 6.13) for 10?years increase, respectively, for men and women). Men with a high rate of transitions had about a 1.2-fold increased risk of all-cause and external-cause mortality compared with those without transitions during their professional life. This association was also observed for women's all-cause mortality. Conclusions Strong associations between professional trajectories and mortality from different causes of death were found. Long exposure to lower socioeconomic conditions was associated with increased mortality risk from various causes of death. The results also suggest gradual associations between transition rates and mortality.",

    "title_s":"The impact of recent reforms on the institutional governance of French universities",
    "abstract_s":"It is usual to identify France as a latecomer in New Public Management (NPM). As stressed by P. Bezes (2003 and 2009 ), while the souci de soi of the French state has always been present and the reform of the management of French public administration has been a recurrent objective during the Fifth Republic, it is only in the late 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s that the NPM doctrine really diffused into the French public system. The important transformations experienced by the higher education system until then (Musselin 2001[2004]) could therefore not be analysed as a consequence of NPM (Musselin and Paradeise 2009). The introduction of NPM methods and solutions in French administration, now in place for a decade, first reached universities in mid-2000 when the new budgetary process that was introduced into French public administration (the LOLF, Loi organique sur les lois de finances ) was also implemented in public higher education institutions. In order to negotiate their budget, they now have to set objectives and indicators that will then be used to measure the achievement of these objectives a year later, when they will write a report about the past year. Further major changes, which will be described below, were introduced after 2005. They not only brought in new instruments and devices to the management of French universities (more competitive processes, performance-based allocation of resources, empowerment of university leaders, etc.), but more broadly affected some of the principles on which the French university system was built and, in particular, the egalitarian principles that maintained a rather low differentiation among French academics and among French universities and the grades they delivered. The aim of this chapter is, therefore, primarily to describe the governance of French universities after the introduction of the recent reforms and answer the following questions: did these changes affect the governance of French universities or did they resist the transformations that aimed at strengthening the presidents, increasing project-based research and providing them with more autonomy and responsibility?",

It attempts to develop a theoretical framework on change and stability management in small firms. Design\/methodology\/approach - This research uses a process approach based on retrospective comparative case study methodology. Data collection in the six companies lasted over a year. This gives the opportunity to contrast failed change initiatives against successful ones. Findings - Two models emerged from this approach; they support the notion that change and stability could be complementary during the different phases of the change initiative the authors analyzed. The findings show that total absence of stability variables in the change initiative could have negative effect on results. Research limitations\/implications - The research is based on a multiple case study approach, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Originality\/value - This is one of the first studies that applies and empirically tests the change and stability relation in small firms.",

    "abstract_s":"Purpose – Eliminating overpackaging is a central question in sustainable development, and poses a dilemma for retailers. Since packaging is a differentiation tool for private labels, eliminating it could limit the capacity to give those labels an equivalent image to national brands just as much as it could be a sustainable development opportunity and a positioning instrument. Drawing on the attribution theory framework, this article examines how eliminating overpackaging influences consumers’ perception of products sold under generic and mimic private labels, and their purchase intention. Methodology – This research uses a 2 (overpackaging: present vs. absent) x 2 (brand concept: generic vs. mimic private label) between-subjects experiment on a convenience sample of 217 French consumers. The conceptual framework was tested using ANCOVA and mediation analyses. Findings – Our experiment shows that eliminating overpackaging does have an influence on mimic private labels’ image, particularly on perceived quality, convenience and environmental friendliness. We also find that this influence negatively transfers to purchase intention for mimic private labels through lower perceived quality and convenience. No such effect appears for generic private labels’ image. Value – This study addresses an issue as yet unexplored in marketing – the effect of overpackaging on private label products – and proposes areas for managerial and societal reflection relevant to retail chains interested in eliminating overpackaging.",

    "abstract_s":"This study analyzes academics’ values in relation with the reforms led in the public sector of higher education. We claim that studying values\/attitudes in a given field is critical to anticipate future institutional changes (Greenwood and Hinnings, 1996), since they are often precursors of concrete practices and behaviors (Campbell, 1963; Summers, 1970). As the reforms of higher education led recently in France have stressed the notion of “performance” – present both in the NPM and Neo-Weberian narratives –, we investigate to what extent the adhesion to a culture of performance is compatible with the maintenance of the commitment to the university “publicness” (Bozeman, 2007) – which is antithetical to the ideology promoted by NPM. In addition, investigating the robustness of university publicness contributes to the debate upon the transformation of public servants’ values.",

    "title_s":"All motivated by public service? The links between hierarchical position and public service motivation",
    "abstract_s":"Research into public service motivation is currently witnessing exponential growth. However, the universal application of the concept to all categories of public employees raises questions. Indeed, the origins of the concept, which can be traced back to political science studies in the United States, may suggest that the concept applies mainly to senior management but much less to operatives of various types, whose motivations seem more instrumental . Research into the antecedents of PSM has thus shown that high hierarchical levels were associated with employee profiles with a high level of PSM (Bright, 2005; Camilleri, 2007). Some authors go as far as to consider that the concept does not apply at all to operative jobs (Gabris and Simo, 1995). The purpose of this article is therefore to analyse the differences between the public service motivation of operatives and that of other categories of employees. To do so, we draw on two empirical studies, one quantitative (n = 2 868), conducted among the public employees of cities in 12 countries, and the other qualitative, conducted among public employees working in the technical service of a French town. Our results show that the level of PSM is not lower among operatives but that, on the other hand, it is different in its nature and dimensions. Notes to practitioners The issue of the PSM of operative public employees takes on a managerial dimension. Indeed, it has potential policy implications for human resource management policies to be implemented and on the segmentation of the public employees in the light of these policies. Our results thus argue for the mainstreaming of the public service dimension in the management of executives and would suggest that it is in the interest of public organisations to encourage the public service motivation of their employees by designing tasks in such a way that public employees can better appreciate the result of their work among customers and users.",

    "abstract_s":"This paper aims to present the state of the art of a rising French research community on knowledge management, who organized during the past four years, a French speaking congress (GeCSO). Interests in knowledge management (KM) come from various disciplines: economy, social, engineering. These interests are not often linked. Within the firms, KM practices vary a lot depending on national cultures and on activity sectors. However, one can identify a potential symmetry between the diversity of practices and the partitioning of scientific approaches. Design\/methodology\/approach – In order to synthesize the different approaches in KM, the authors studied the 62 papers published in the first three conferences. To have a first representation of the diversity, they analyzed the keywords that were used: among 173 keywords used by the authors, eight keywords represent 27 per cent of the total amount. Findings – Three main dimensions which emerged from the articles are analysed: the practical dimension, the epistemological point of view, and the intention to define a theory of action. Originality\/value – KM is an emerging domain, especially in French culture. This paper can be seen as a first foundation of the domain, and also a manifesto to develop interdisciplinary research on this topic.",

The inherent innovation potential of these global firms only materializes if the various entities cooperate efficiently and succeed in merging together their contributions. The object of this article is to examine the practical forms that this cooperation takes, so as to detect, by observing actors in global organisations, what barriers and difficulties they meet. This paper presents the empirical study of the dynamics of two R&D teams within a major French industrial group. By studying how the daily teamwork takes place, this article takes a critical look at the new models of organization and assesses how far they really favour innovation.",

It argues that in order to grasp national cultures and discover team members' sense -making systems, it is necessary to understand the extent to which the actors diverge or converge in managing collective action. Based on the members'national and professional profiles, institutional contexts and interaction modes as well as their differences in goals, Chevrier proposes 5 types of intercultural teams: strategic coordination teams, mixed operational teams, project teams, professional teams and quasi-homogenous teams. The author also maintains that cross-cultural management may be derived from the general processes of coordination which can be classifed under two categories - interpersonal coordination and interpersonal coordination. The first category includes mutual adjustment and direct supervision. The second category encompasses the standardization of processes, results and values (through organizational ideology) and skills The configurational framework delineates how each type of team can use different cross-cultural management modes to enhance its effectiveness.",

    "abstract_s":"This paper presents exploratory research in which three French peer-to-peer car-sharing companies are studied in terms of how they handle their co-production service models and control deviant customer behavior. The study draws on a theoretical framework based on the literature on customer involvement in service co-production, on deviant customer behavior management, and on the general typology of organizational modes of control proposed by Chiapello (1996). Three co-production models related to three control patterns of consumer behavior are identified. First, the transactional model of industrial co-production is associated with strong, highly instrumented control exercised by the organization. Second, the model of relational co-production is associated with control by the market and delegation to consumers. Third, the model of community co-production is associated with strong control based on the community itself. The paper concludes by discussing the strong links that may exist between co-production systems, control systems and business models for each of the companies studied.",

Second, the composition of governance bodies has been examined. In AdM, tensions occur among colleges and involve employees and volunteers. In Websourd, conflicts emerge within the employees' college and focus on ambiguity regarding roles between, on one the hand, employees and managers and, on the other, between deaf and hearing people. Finally, concerning governing bodies's operations, a power imbalance among their stakeholders has been noticed. In both organizations, expertise and skills are seen as essential, and members with the most power are conferred the greatest legitimacy.",

    "abstract_s":"Are we witnessing the decline of state involvement in education or is it being reshaped, and if so how? Surprisingly, this question has received little attention from researchers in education studies, sociology and political science. This book aims to fill this gap by exploring school evaluation policies in four European countries: England, France, Scotland and Switzerland. It shows that the same policy tool - promoted in many European and international arenas concerned with good practice in educational governance - can actually give rise in each system to a variety of policy configurations in which forms of state control can differ. Written from a policy sociology perspective, the book aims to go beyond the decline\/permanence dichotomy and proposes a specific conceptual framework within which to consider both contextualised forms of state intervention and their potential similarities and combinations. By doing this, the authors not only aim to counterbalance or supplement dominant views on the Europeanisation and transnationalisation of education policies but also to imagine new possibilities for state policy analysis.",

We consider five different institutional factors and distinguish two categories of measures: country’s quality of legal institutions and laws protecting shareholder rights. Our results show that firms from countries with better institutional environment are more likely to engage in CSR activities, supporting both the prominent role of institutional environment in explaining CSP variation across firms and the CSR-value enhancing view. Moreover, both country’s quality of legal institutions and laws protecting shareholders rights explain scores on four domains: Environment, Corporate Governance, Human Resources and Human Rights. However, Business Behavior domain is only related to an indicator measuring laws protecting shareholders rights. Community Involvement is related to the quality of legal institutions in the country. Finally, we show that CSP is negatively affected by leverage and positively affected by firm size. However, CSP is not related to firm profitability.",

As a consequence, the issue has captured the attention of policymakers throughout the world.Several countries are currently adopting or considering the adoption of laws or regulations to promote gender diversity on corporate boards. The purpose of this paper is to compare the effectiveness of using legislative or regulatory means to increase female representation instead of allowing firms to voluntarily fix their own non legally binding targets. We find that the relation between gender diversity and performance is positive in countries using the voluntary approach while it is negative in countries using the regulatory approach. We conclude that public policy aimed at increasing the number of women on corporate boards should be introduced gradually and voluntarily rather than quickly and coercively to avoid sub-optimal board composition.",

    "title_s":"Do women on boards and on top management reduce earnings management? Evidence in France",
    "abstract_s":"The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of gender diversity on the boardroom and on top management positions on earnings management by French-listed firms. Based on a sample of 170 firms over 4 years, we find that the proportion of women on the board standing as a director or a chair reduces earnings management. This finding suggests that women are effective on their monitoring role and are then considered as a crucial corporate governance device. We also find that the relationship between the presence of at least three women on the board and earnings management is negative suggesting that by increasing the number of women on board through regulation and legislation, French firms are likely to enhance the effectiveness of the board to better detect earnings management. However, Women standing in CEO and CFO positions do not affect earnings management practices. These findings suggest that efforts made by political bodies to promote equality between men and women on boards are beneficial for French-listed companies by limiting earnings management practices. However, regulating or imposing a quota of women on boards can create a temporal shortage of qualified women available to take up such positions.",

The government can support demand in sectors concentrating bio-jobs through public procurement, orshe can develop them through targeted exemptions. The most effective and relevant combination of theseinstruments is looked for via an original framework. We show that the action of the government is driven by thenature of the sectors and especially the level of an existing private demand. Then, the level of the wages plays amajor role in the government budget decision. We finally apply these recommendations to French data.",

    "abstract_s":"To what extent is political participation deepened and enriched by the Internet? Isthe Internet more inclusive—especially towards the young—than traditional formsof participation requiring physical contact? Do people learn more by discussing onthe Internet—and especially in online political forums—than by deliberating face-to-face? We aim to answer these questions by presenting the results of research based on the observation of a deliberative experience that allowed both online andface-to-face participation, namely the IDEAL-EU project, carried out by theTuscany (Italy), Catalonia (Spain), and Poitou-Charentes (France) regions. IDEAL-EU was aimed at involving young people—between ages 14 and 30—to discuss theissue of climate change in order to produce a report to be handed to the President of the European Parliament Commission on Climate Change. It first consisted in onlinediscussion forums, and then in an electronic town meeting organized in the threeregions' capitals in November 2008. This town meeting involved both keypad votingand face-to-face discussions in small groups. The comparison of these two stages of the experience allows evaluation of the respective effects of online and face-to-face political discussions on young participants’ political knowledge. Using contentanalysis of websites, direct observation of the assembly, and interviews andquestionnaires completed by both online and assembly participants, we evaluate the respective effects of these different forms of civic engagement for actors' perceived level of knowledge on climate change and on their political competence moregenerally.",

Scholars have tried to operationalisethe theoretical dimensions of deliberative democracy into robust criteria inorder to evaluate the quality of public discussion. Few of them however havesystematically compared online and offline deliberation to analyse the link between the technological formats deployed in a deliberative procedure and thequality of the discussion. This is what this paper aims to do through a Frenchcase study of a national public debate. Drawing from a revised version of theDiscourse Quality Index, we will theoretically discuss and propose a codingscheme for quality analysis which rests on an enlarged definition of deliberation.

Using data for 314 GPTs from 18 Western European countries, we find that the announcements of GPTs generate a cumulative average abnormal return of about 22% and that pre-transaction shareholders on average receive a raw premium of about 36%. We further find that these shareholder wealth gains increase with the degree of separation of cash-flow and control rights of the pre-transaction ultimate owner and decrease with its ownership interests and with the presence of a second large shareholder. Taken together, these findings support the view that GPTs are expected to mitigate the inefficiencies induced by pre-transaction agency problems between controlling and minority shareholders. Thus, shareholder wealth gains from GPTs reflect the potential additional value that will be created under private ownership.",

    "abstract_s":"This paper examines the effect of controlling shareholders on stock price synchronicity by focusing on two salient corporate governance features in a concentrated ownership setting, namely, ultimate cash flow rights and the separation of voting and cash flow rights (i.e., excess control). Using a unique dataset of 654 French listed firms spanning 1998–2007, this study provides evidence that stock price synchronicity increases with excess control, supporting the argument that controlling shareholders tend to disclose less firm-specific information to conceal opportunistic practices. Additionally, this study shows that firms with substantial excess control are more likely to experience stock price crashes, consistent with the conjecture that controlling shareholders are more likely to hoard bad information when their control rights exceed their cash flow rights. Another important finding is that firms’ stock prices are less synchronous and less likely to crash when controlling shareholders own a large fraction of cash flow rights. This is consistent with the argument that controlling shareholders have less incentive to adopt poor disclosure policies and to accumulate bad news, since high cash flow ownership aligns their interests with those of minority investors.",

It contrasts a sample of 161 firms that went private between 1997 and 2009 with a propensity-score-matched sample of firms that remained public during the same period. The results indicate that, unlike for firms that remain public, the largest controlling shareholders (LCSs) of GP firms control their firms using an incommensurately small fraction of ultimate cash flow rights. This is consistent with the view that agency problems between large and minority shareholders make public firms less attractive to investors, which reduces the benefits of staying public and encourages the LCSs to take their firms private or accept takeover offers. Additional results show that GP firms have more undervalued stock prices and higher free cash flows than non-GP firms. Expected interest tax shields, low growth opportunities, and pre-GP takeover interest do not seem to affect the probability of GP.",

Since large controlling shareholders in such firms maintain grip on control while owning an incommensurate small fraction of ownership rights, we are in a situation where their interests depart from that of the minority shareholders. Using a sample of 377 French firms, we show that firms featuring a substantial likelihood of expropriation (higher discrepancy between cash flow rights and control rights or group-affiliated), present lower leverage ratios than others due to debt supply restrictions. Contrariwise, the presence of second large controlling shareholder is perceived by external finance suppliers as a pledge against expropriation. Therefore, such firms exhibit high debt levels.",

Using data for 510 French publicly traded firms, the current study provides evidence in support of the entrenchment hypothesis. The results show that large controlling shareholders maintaining grip on control while holding only small fraction of cash flow rights are inclined to expropriate minority shareholders, which in turn detrimentally affects the firm's valuation. The evidence also indicates that pyramiding is the main device set to unduly entrench the large controlling shareholder. Additional analysis reveals that the identity of the second largest controlling shareholder matters. Sharing control with a family constrains the largest controlling shareholder to steer clear of self-serving behavior. However sharing control with a widely held firm or with a financial institution fosters this self-serving behavior.",
